Link to my image in docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/anlideer/py-flask-example/general

### Run the project via docker

```
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 anlideer/py-flask-example
```

Then your localhost:5000 should show a text "Hello, World!". (The source project is also attached as "original-repo-ignore" in the same folder as this file, but normally you can just ignore it.)
